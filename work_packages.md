Figure 1 shows the seven Work Packages (WPs) that cover CATRINâ€™s management, research, experimentation, and dissemination activities. We have two overarching WPs for Project Management and Dissemination and Knowledge Utilization (WP0 and WP6, respectively). We have four research WPs (WP1, WP2, WP3, WP4) that feed into the WP for the delivery of the prototype, where we also consult with policy experts and where we validate our work in practical trials (WP5).
